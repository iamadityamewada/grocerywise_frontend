## Original User Request:
Build a fully functional, scalable SaaS platform for Grocery Management using React.js for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and SQLite (with an option to migrate to PostgreSQL in production). The platform must include:

Authentication & Authorization:

Secure user registration and login (with JWT-based authentication).

Support multi-tenancy (users should only access their own data).

Password hashing with secure encryption (e.g., bcrypt).

User Management:

Each user has their own isolated grocery data.

Allow account settings: update email, password, and delete account.

Grocery Management Module:

Complete CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete groceries).

Filter, sort, and search groceries.

Track grocery status (e.g., purchased, pending).

Subscription/Plan Management (for SaaS Expansion):

Role/plan-based restrictions (e.g., free users have limited grocery items, paid users have unlimited access).

Setup future payment gateway integration (Stripe/PayPal-ready architecture).

API Standards:

RESTful API design with clean versioning (/api/v1/).

Proper error handling, validation (Pydantic for FastAPI schemas).

Secure protected routes for authenticated users only.

Frontend:

Responsive UI (using bootstrap).

React Router for page navigation.

Global authentication context (token handling and auto-login persistence).

API integration service layer (using Axios).

User-friendly notifications for errors, successes, and actions.

Best Practices & Scalability:

Backend organized using modular structure (routes, models, schemas, services, auth separated).

Frontend structured for component reusability and scalability.

Prepare backend code for future database migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL.

Docker-ready setup (optional for production scaling).

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js, TailwindCSS

Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, JWT, Pydantic

Database: SQLite (dev) -> PostgreSQL (prod)

Optional (Extra Polish):

Add simple analytics dashboard (e.g., number of groceries managed).

Allow exporting grocery lists (CSV or PDF format).

Add dark/light theme toggle.
